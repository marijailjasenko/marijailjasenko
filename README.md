Hi everyone!ðŸ‘‹ My name is ``Marija`` and I am junior data analyst. Originally I have master's degree in pharmacy and health management and 
worked for pharmaceutical company as pharmacovigilance specialist and compliance specialist. Also I am a lecturer at university 
and teach Clinical trials to pharmacy students. I always been interested in data analysis and visualisation and so decided to develop 
in this area.
